When a humble bard graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia, along came this song
From when the White Wolf fought a silver-tongued devil
His army of elves at his hooves did they revel
They came after me with masterful deceit
Broke down my lute and they kicked in my teeth
While the devil's horns minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher "He can't be bleat!"

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty!
O Valley of Plenty!
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty!

At the edge of the world fight the mighty horn
That bashes and breaks you and brings you to mourn
He thrust every elf far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain from whence it came
He wiped out your pest got kicked in his chest
He's a friend of humanity so give him the rest
That's my epic tale our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain now pour him some ale

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty!
O Valley of Plenty!
Toss a coin to your Witcher
A friend of humanity

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty!
O Valley of Plenty!
Toss a coin to your Witcher
A friend of humanity

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty!
O Valley of Plenty!
Toss a coin to your Witcher
A friend of humanity
